This project allows users to manage a to-do list.
The user first needs to create an account and log in, 
after that, he can create his own task list.
To create a new task, the user needs to enter a title and description (creation time automatically added to each task).
Each user can view his task list and mark each task as completed/not completed.
Additionally, it is possible to search/edit/delete tasks.
